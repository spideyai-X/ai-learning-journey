# Environment & Tooling

- Respect environment/lock files: uv.lock, package.json, package-lock.json.
- Do not change tooling unless necessary; verify compatibility first.
- Keep Markdown as the source of truth; HTML is the rendered companion for Pages.

# Changelog & Commit Hygiene

- Update CHANGELOG.md concisely for notable changes.
- Group related edits into one clear commit with descriptive message.
- Commit messages must be concise.
- When a commit includes course notes (Markdown/HTML in modules), the message should describe only the learning content added/updated (what topics/sections were introduced or clarified) and avoid mentioning unrelated housekeeping.
