# Content Workflow & Structure

## Sources of truth
- Notes are written in Markdown and mirrored to HTML for GitHub Pages (https://spideystreet.github.io/ai-learning-journey/).
- Keep Markdown and HTML pairs in the same module folder (e.g., 03-nlp/..., 04-deep-learning/...).

## Editing discipline
- Be concise and verify information before modifying content.
- Preserve indentation/structure; do not reflow unrelated sections.
- When adding visuals, use accessible sizes and meaningful alt text.

## Versioning
- Maintain a concise CHANGELOG.md for notable content/formatting updates.
- Prefer grouped, descriptive commits.
