# AI Learning Journey – Cursor Rules (Umbrella)

Use these split rules for authoritative guidance:

- `content-workflow.mdc` – project context, structure, workflow, and editing discipline
- `formatting-and-math.mdc` – HTML/CSS styles, imagery, and LaTeX math conventions
- `environment-and-changelog.mdc` – environment/lock files and changelog/commit hygiene

Principles to remember (summary):
- Markdown is the source of truth; generate matching HTML for GitHub Pages.
- Respect shared styles in `styles/`; use LaTeX for all math (no code‑styled formulas).
- Keep edits concise, verified, and minimally invasive. Maintain `CHANGELOG.md`.
