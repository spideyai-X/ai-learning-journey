# AI Learning Journey – Cursor Rules

## Project context
- This repo hosts academic learning notes (see `README.md`).
- Notes are authored in Markdown and also rendered to HTML for GitHub Pages at: `https://spideystreet.github.io/ai-learning-journey/`.

## Content workflow
1. Write/maintain notes in Markdown.
2. Generate matching HTML for each note so it renders properly on GitHub Pages.
3. Keep the Markdown and HTML pairs in the same module folder (e.g., `03-nlp/...`, `04-deep-learning/...`).

## Formatting & styles (HTML)
- Always respect shared styles in `styles/` (typography, layout, KaTeX setup).
- Use centered images and side‑by‑side blocks (utility classes are defined in CSS when needed).
- Keep headings readable and consistent (Instrument Serif for headings, Inter Tight for body as configured in CSS).

## Mathematics
- Use LaTeX for all mathematical notation.
- Prefer inline math: `$ ... $` and display math: `$$ ... $$` (KaTeX is initialized in notes HTML).
- Avoid rendering math as code (no grey inline code for formulas).

## Sources & references
- Academic papers live under `papers/`. Reference or link them from notes as needed.

## Versioning & changelog
- Maintain a concise changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` for notable content/formatting updates.
- When feasible, group related edits into one clear commit with a descriptive message.

## Environment & tooling
- Respect environment metadata and locks: `uv.lock`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`.
- Do not introduce tooling changes without necessity; verify compatibility before updating.

## Editing rules
- Be concise and verify information before modifying content.
- Preserve existing indentation/structure; do not reflow unrelated sections.
- When adding visuals, ensure sizes are consistent and accessible (alt text required).
- Keep Markdown as the source of truth; HTML is the rendered companion.
