## 16 Sept. 2025 - Deep Learning tabular MLP notes

- Added section “Predictions with neural networks on tabular data” in `04-deep-learning/151.1-dense-neural-network/notes.md`.
- Clarified MLP flow (H1, H2, O), training pipeline (architecture → compile → fit), and key notions (batch_size, epochs, validation_split).
- Included concise Keras examples for `compile` and `fit`.
- Mirrored content to `notes.html` with KaTeX math and centered visuals.

## 15 Sept. 2025 - Deep Learning intro structured; papers added

- Deep Learning (151.1) notes: restructured and corrected markdown; clarified perceptron, dot product, linear separability, loss, activations, and gradient descent; centered images; added KaTeX-friendly HTML rendering.
- Added/organized papers folder references (reading resources).
- Consistent formatting across notes (HTML/CSS image centering, math delimiters).
