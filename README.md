# AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI Learning Journey. This repository documents my progress through the different domains of Artificial Intelligence, from foundational concepts in Machine Learning.  
Im actually learning the complexities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and beyond. Join me as I explore, experiment, and build! :)

## Learning Modules

***[WIP]*** **Natural Language Processing** : 
- [Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression](https://spideystreet.github.io/ai-learning-journey/03-nlp/03.1-sentiment-analysis-with-logitic-regression/notes.html)  
- [Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes](https://spideystreet.github.io/ai-learning-journey/03-nlp/03.2-sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes/notes.html)  

***[WIP]*** **Deep Learning** : 
- [Deep Learning: Dense neural network](https://spideystreet.github.io/ai-learning-journey/151.1-dense-neural-network.html).

*(More modules will be added as I progress.)*
