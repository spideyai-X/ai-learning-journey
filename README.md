# AI Learning Journey

This repository serves as a personal log and portfolio of my journey into the field of Artificial Intelligence. It is a structured collection of notes, code implementations, and projects covering a wide range of AI concepts, from foundational Machine Learning to advanced topics in Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modules, each corresponding to a major area of AI. Within each module, you will find sub-modules dedicated to specific topics, algorithms, or projects. This modular structure is designed to provide a clear and progressive learning path.

Each sub-module typically contains:
- **`data/`**: Datasets used in the notebooks.
- **`images/`**: Visual aids, diagrams, and plots referenced in the notes and notebooks.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks with practical code implementations, experiments, and step-by-step tutorials.
- **`notebooks/notes.md`**: Detailed theoretical explanations, mathematical concepts, and key takeaways.

## Learning Modules

This section will be updated as new modules are added.

### 03. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **03.1 - Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression**: 
  - [Notes](./03-nlp/03.1-sentiment-analysis-with-logitic-regression/notes.md)
  - [Notebooks](./03-nlp/03.1-sentiment-analysis-with-logitic-regression/notebooks/)

## Versioning

The version numbers for this repository will follow my progress through the learning modules. Each significant addition or completion of a topic will correspond to a new version, providing a clear timeline of my learning journey.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse the different modules. If you want to run the code locally, you will need to have a Python environment set up with standard data science libraries such as [Requirements](./requirements.txt). Specific requirements for each module are usually listed at the beginning of the notebooks.
